In this project I am developing a Chatbot with Python using Machine Learning, Since this is just a chatbot. I just created my own dataset to train the model.
To create this dataset to create a chatbot with Python, we need to understand what intents we are going to train. An “intention” is the user’s intention to interact with a chatbot or the intention behind every message the chatbot receives from a particular user.Therefore, it is important to understand the good intentions of your chatbot depending on the domain you will be working with.
In order to answer questions asked by the users and perform various other tasks to continue conversations with the users, the chatbot really needs to understand what users are saying or having ‘intention to do. This is our chatbot must understand the intentions behind users’ messages.
